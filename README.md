## Version 2.2.9

> ### Deprecation Notice
> Please note that the [Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# v2.x](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl) is deprecated.

> #### What deprecation means
> * Splunk will no longer provide any feature enhancements, bug fixes and support to the Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# v2.x.
> * The resources relating to the Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# v2.x will soon be removed from [dev.splunk.com](https://dev.splunk.com/) and will only be available in the GitHub repository.
> * Apps that use the Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# v2.x will continue to work as they do now.

> #### Recommendation for new app development and app updates
> Splunk is no longer investing in the Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# v2.x. We recommend that any app development be done using these other approaches:
> * Using one of the supported SDKs:
>   * Python ([splunk-sdk-python](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-python) | [Splunk Enterprise SDK for Python](http://dev.splunk.com/view/python-sdk/SP-CAAAEBB))
>   * Java ([splunk-sdk-java](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-java) | [Splunk Enterprise SDK for Java](http://dev.splunk.com/view/java-sdk/SP-CAAAECN))
>   * JavaScript ([splunk-sdk-javascript](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-javascript) | [Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript](http://dev.splunk.com/view/javascript-sdk/SP-CAAAECM))

> * Directly using the Splunk REST API in the language of their choice.

> For existing apps that use the Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# v2.x, we request that developers update their apps to use one of the above approaches. We encourage you to post your feedback and questions regarding this to [Splunk Answers](https://community.splunk.com/t5/Splunk-Development/ct-p/developer-tools) in the "Splunk Development" community with the tag **splunk-csharp-sdk**.


The Splunk Enterprise Software Development Kit (SDK) for C# contains library code and examples designed to enable developers to build applications using the Splunk platform.

The Splunk platform is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search, and process large time-varying data sets.

The Splunk platform is popular with system administrators for aggregation and monitoring of IT machine data, security, compliance, and a wide variety of other scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently index, search, analyze, and generate real-time notifications from large volumes of time-series data.

The Splunk developer platform enables developers to take advantage of the same technology used by the Splunk platform to build exciting new applications.

For more information, see [Splunk Enterprise SDK for C#](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/devtools/csharp/sdk-csharp/) on the Splunk Developer Portal.

## What's new in Version 2.x

Version 2.0 introduces new modern APIs that leverage the latest .NET platform advancements.

* Async. All APIs are 100% asynchronous supporting the new [async/await](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh191443.aspx) features.
* All APIs follow .NET guidelines and abide by FxCop and StyleCop rules.
* Reactive Extensions. Splunk Enterprise query results implement [IObservable<T>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd990377), allowing usage with the [.NET Reactive Extensions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/gg577610).
* Support for cross-platform development. The Splunk API client (Splunk.Client.dll) in the new version is a [Portable Class Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vstudio/gg597391.aspx) supporting .NET development on multiple platforms.

Below is an example of a simple one shot search:

```csharp
using Splunk.Client;

var service = new Service(new Uri("https://localhost:8089"));

//login
await service.LogOnAsync("admin", "changeme");

//create a One Shot Search and retrieve the results
var searchResults = await service.SearchOneShotSearchAsync("search index=_internal | head 10");

//loop through the results
foreach (var result in searchResults)
{
    //write out the raw event
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("{0:D8}: {1}", ++recordNumber, result.GetValue("_raw")));
}
```

## Supported platforms

This SDK supports .NET 4.5/Mono 3.4, PCL (Windows 8.1), iOS (via Xamarin.iOS), and Android (via Xamarin.Android) platforms.

## Compatibility

The Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# version 2.x is a rewrite of the 1.x SDK, and introduces completely new APIs.

>**Important**: Applications built with Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# version 1.x will not recompile using Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# version 2.xf.

Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# version 2.x includes a subset of the capability in version 1.0 of the SDK, and focuses on the most common customer scenarios. The major focus areas are search, search jobs, configuration, and modular inputs.

The areas that are covered are:
* Login
* Access control (users and passwords)
* Searches (normal, blocking, oneshot, and export)
* Jobs
* Reports (saved searches)
* Configuration and properties
* Indexes
* Inputs (sending simple and streamed events to Splunk Enterprise)
* Applications
* Modular inputs

See the [Splunk REST API Coverage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lTlJ_z4tBpn_xPnJNDapiAxwdtQWvFGH31G6WIkMYwU/edit#gid=0) for details.

## Getting started with the Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# 

The Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# contains library code and examples that show how to programmatically interact with the Splunk platform for a variety of scenarios including searching, saved searches, data inputs, and many more, along with building complete applications.

### Requirements

Here's what you need to get going with the Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# version 2.x.

*  Splunk Enterprise
   
   If you haven't already installed Splunk Enterprise, download it [here](http://www.splunk.com/download). For more information, see the Splunk Enterprise [_Installation Manual_](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation).
   
   The Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# has been tested with Splunk Enterprise 7.0 and 7.2.

*  Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# 
   
    *  Use the MyGet feed

        Download the Splunk SDK C# NuGet packages from [MyGet](http://www.myget.org). Add the following feed to your package sources in Visual Studio:
        `https://splunk.myget.org/F/splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl/`

        The following packages are in that feed:
        * **Splunk.Client**: Client for the Splunk Enterprise REST API. This library is portable.
        * **Splunk.ModularInputs**: Functionality for building modular inputs.
         
            >**Note**: Both packages are published to NuGet when the SDK is released.
        
    *  Get the source

        Download the [Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# ZIP file](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl/archive/master.zip) and extract the contents. If you are want to contribute to the Splunk Enterprise SDK for C#, clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-csharp).

### Developer environments

The Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# supports development in the following environments:

*   [Microsoft Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/downloads) 2012 and later

    You must also install [Code Contracts for .NET](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1ec7db13-3363-46c9-851f-1ce455f66970). 
    
    >**Note**: Close Visual Studio before installing Code Contracts. Otherwise, the installation will not work, despite appearing to.
    
    To run the unit tests, install an [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) runner. If you use resharper, install its [xUnit.net Test Support](https://resharper-plugins.jetbrains.com/packages/xunitcontrib/1.6.2). Otherwise, install the [xUnit.net runner for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/463c5987-f82b-46c8-a97e-b1cde42b9099).

*  Xamarin Studio and Mono Develop

    You must set the MonoCS compilation constant in the project settings for **Splunk.Client.csproj** and **Splunk.ModularInputs.csproj**.

    To run the unit tests, download [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/releases) and run it using the command-line tools or GUI runner.


#### Build the SDK

To build the SDK, the examples, and the unit tests after extracting or cloning the SDK:

1. At the root level of the **splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl** directory, open the **splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl.sln** file in Visual Studio.
2. On the **BUILD** menu, click **Build Solution**.

#### Examples and unit tests

The Splunk Enterprise SDK for C# includes full unit tests that run using [xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) as well as several examples.
